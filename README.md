# pivot-episodes
Convert "VAR" dataset format: from episodes ("status" from ... to ...) per id into timelines, (year, month) from first observation to end of year under investigation, one per id, with up to 5 "status" per timestamp (year, month).

Code is written for VVL.VAR datasets (from 2011 on), may need some adjusting (variable names etc.) for others.
